//Functions

//So far we have seen many built-in JavaScript functions. In this section, we will foccus on custom functions. What is a function? Before we start making functions, let's understand what function is and why we need function?


// A function is a resuable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. A funcitons is declared by a funciton key word followed by a name, followed by parentheses(). A parentheses can take a parameter. If a function take a parameter, it will be called with argument. A function can also take a defualt parameter. To store a data to a function, a function has to return certain data types. To get the value we call or invoke a function. Function makes code:

//1. clean and easy to read
//2. reusable
//3. easy to test

//A function can be declared or created in couple of ways:
//1. Declaration funciton
//2. Expression function
//3. Anonymous function
//4. Arrow function

function input(n) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${n}`);
}

input("Emran");
